# COV19Visualiser
A data analysis project analysing COVID 19 cases and deaths across various countries using pands and matplotlib.
This was backported from .ipynb.

The project is technically unfinished in the sense that there's still stuff that I did want to expand on (i.e., AI for future projections)
and the last run was ~01/2021.

Below are the results shown from within the Jupyter notebook at time of last run:
